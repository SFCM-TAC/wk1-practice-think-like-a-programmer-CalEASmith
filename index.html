    <div class="question">
      What experience (if any) do you have with programming?
      (None is fine!)
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      I've messed around in C# and Max/MSP.

    <p>
    <div class="question">
      What's something you'd like to be able to build/do with programming?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      I would like to understand the basics and be able to think and evaluate
      problems from a programmer's perspective so that, down the road, communicating
      game design ideas will become a more fluid process.

    <h1>Think Like a Programmer</h1>

    <div class="question">
      Pretend you are writing a plugin that automatically harmonizes with MIDI input.
      What instructions would you give a computer to do this programmatically?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Analyse the MIDI input for pitch and ADSR. Have it generate two or three
      more MIDI notes that match the envelope of the original, but have added pitch values.
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="question">
      Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the istrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Model a theremin. Produce a sine wave and interpolate between notes to produce a glide effect.
